# AI-Powered Retargeting: From Setup Hell to One-Click Automation

Retargeting delivers the highest ROI in digital marketing, but most marketers avoid it because setup is a nightmare.

## The Retargeting Setup Problem

Reddit is full of marketers struggling with retargeting complexity:

> *"I want to import my Google Ads conversions into GA4... I know how to import my GA4 conversions into Google Ads. But I want it the other way around."* - u/Shoddy_Classroom5402

> *"I just ran my first retargeting campaign on Meta ads, and CTR doubled. Crazy what a warm audience does... Anyone else crushing retargeting lately?"* - u/Upset_Fan_5178

The problem? Traditional retargeting requires juggling multiple platforms:
- Create custom audiences in Google Analytics
- Set up conversion tracking (key events)
- Link Google Analytics to Google Ads  
- Build retargeting campaigns
- Optimize based on performance data

**Each step requires platform expertise and manual configuration.** Most marketers either skip retargeting or implement it poorly.
