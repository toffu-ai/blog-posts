Last week, I was browsing r/marketing when I stumbled across this question that made me stop scrolling:

*"Marketers managing ads across platforms - what's your reporting workflow and how do you track ROI? Do you use any tools other than Excel and Google Sheets?"*

The responses were... enlightening. And by enlightening, I mean they confirmed what I suspected: most of us are flying blind when it comes to actual ROI measurement.

## The Spreadsheet Nightmare Is Real

One marketer laid it out perfectly:

*"Excel and Google Sheets are fine for small scale or one channel reporting. But the moment you go multi-platform (Google, Meta, LinkedIn), things get messy fast."*

Sound familiar? You start with one Google Ads campaign. Simple enough - throw the numbers in a spreadsheet, calculate your ROAS, call it a day. Then you add Facebook ads. Now you need another tab. Then LinkedIn. Another tab. Suddenly you're the person with 47 spreadsheet tabs trying to figure out which platform is actually making you money.

But here's the kicker - even if you manage to wrangle all that data into one place, you're still missing the bigger picture.

## Platform Attribution Is Lying to You

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: platform attribution is broken. Google Ads will happily tell you it drove 100 conversions. Facebook will claim credit for 80 of those same conversions. LinkedIn says it influenced 60 of them.

Quick math check: 100 + 80 + 60 = 240 conversions from what was actually 50 real customers.

One Reddit user explained their solution:

*"Once we started analyzing influence across the funnel like assisted conversions, multi-touch journeys, our budget allocation decisions got way sharper."*

The problem is that platforms only see their slice of the customer journey. Facebook doesn't know that your customer saw a Google ad first, visited your site three times, read two blog posts, then finally converted after clicking a retargeting ad.

## The Real Cost of Bad Attribution

I learned this lesson the hard way with a client who was convinced Facebook ads weren't working. Facebook's dashboard showed a 2.5x ROAS - not great, but not terrible. We were about to pause the campaigns.

Then we dug deeper. Turns out Facebook was driving 40% of the top-of-funnel traffic that was later converting through Google Ads searches. Kill the Facebook campaigns, and Google Ads conversions dropped by 35% two weeks later.

This is why another Redditor mentioned they *"apply a scaling factor to our attributed revenue to make it match our channel experimental results."* They're basically saying the attribution is so off that they have to guess at what the real numbers should be.

## The "It's Complicated" Problem

Here's what one marketer shared about their tracking setup:

*"A customer comes to the site via an ad click, our internal tracking resolves source and performs identity resolution, then the data dumped into bigquery. If the customer makes a purchase, our MTA allocates credit based on the last X number of days."*

Reading that made my head spin, and I do this for a living. Most small businesses don't have a data engineering team to build custom attribution models in BigQuery.

But you know what? You don't need to.

## A Simple Framework That Actually Works

After years of helping businesses untangle their attribution mess, here's what I've found works for most companies:

### 1. Start with your CRM, not your ad platforms

Your CRM knows the truth - it knows which leads became customers and how much they spent. Start there and work backward.

### 2. Use UTM parameters religiously

Every. Single. Link. I mean it. Your Google ads should have `utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=whatever`. Your Facebook ads should have `utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=whatever`.

Yes, it's tedious. Do it anyway.

### 3. Look at the whole funnel, not just the last click

Set up Google Analytics to show [assisted conversions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1191180). You'll probably discover that your "worst performing" channels are actually driving your best customers - they just take longer to convert.

### 4. Use first-party data

Ask customers how they heard about you. I know, revolutionary concept. But a simple "How did you hear about us?" field in your checkout process will tell you things no attribution model can.

## Tools That Don't Require a PhD

You don't need to build a custom data warehouse to get better attribution. Here are some options that won't break your budget or your brain:

- **[HubSpot's attribution reporting](https://www.hubspot.com/attribution-reporting)** - If you're already using HubSpot, their multi-touch attribution is solid and doesn't require a data science degree
- **[Google Analytics 4's data-driven attribution](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10596866)** - It's free and works better than most people think (once you set it up properly)
- **[Triple Whale](https://www.triplewhale.com/)** - Built specifically for e-commerce attribution across platforms
- **[Northbeam](https://www.northbeam.io/)** - More advanced but still user-friendly compared to building your own

## The Bottom Line

Your marketing ROI numbers are probably wrong. Not because you're bad at math, but because you're trying to solve a complex attribution puzzle with incomplete data and platform bias.

The solution isn't more complex tracking or fancier tools (though those can help). It's getting comfortable with the fact that attribution will never be perfect, and building systems that give you directionally correct insights instead of precisely wrong numbers.

As one marketer put it perfectly: *"We cross check platform reported view through data with our CRM and web analytics. When direct signals are missing, we use probabilistic modeling."*

Translation: they make educated guesses based on multiple data sources instead of trusting any single platform's claims.

Stop trying to track every click and start focusing on the metrics that actually matter for your business. Your sanity (and your marketing budget) will thank you.
