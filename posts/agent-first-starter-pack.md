# Agent-First Starter Pack  
*How to run lean by replacing headcount with agents + automations*  

---

## Why Agent-First Matters  
Most founders think the only way to scale is to hire.  
But what if you could replace six full-time roles with agents and automations — for about $1K/month?  

That's the reality of running an **agent-first company**.  
This guide shows how I replaced ~$600K in annual salaries with ~$12K in agents, what I learned along the way, and how you can start doing the same.  

---

## 1. Where It All Started  
In [June 2023, OpenAI announced function calling](https://openai.com/index/function-calling-and-other-api-updates/).  

That blog post was a turning point. It showed me that agents weren't just chatbots anymore — they could reliably call tools.  
That's when I stopped thinking of them as "helpers" and started treating them as **role replacements**.  

---

## 2. The Tradeoff  
Agents are unbeatable at structured, repetitive work.  
But they're not creative. They recycle patterns and often sound repetitive.  

I accept that limitation.  
I save my own creativity for high-leverage judgment calls and strategy.  

---

## 3. My Oversight Model  
I don't micro-manage agents.  
I only review **end results**, not every detail.  

- If [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) fixes a bug, I check the outcome, not every line.  
- If [Toffu.ai](https://www.toffu.ai/) drafts a campaign, I skim the flow, not every sentence.  
- If [Hud.io](https://www.hud.io/) provides MCP context, I just confirm the issue is resolved.  
- If [Sentry Seer](https://sentry.io/for/seer/) opens a PR, I review and merge — I don't expect perfection.  

This lightweight oversight keeps me fast while still in control.  

---

## 4. The Big Mistake I Made  
At first, I tried to **save on tokens and credits**.  
That was a mistake.  

These costs are peanuts compared to the time saved.  
Anyone valuing their time shouldn't be counting tokens.  

---

## 5. The Biggest Misconception  
Most people expect agents to deliver perfect results, every time.  

They compare them to:  
- SaaS products with zero bugs  
- Human employees who never make mistakes  

That's unrealistic.  
Agents require iteration — just like onboarding a junior teammate. You need to give feedback, retry, refine.  

---

## 6. The Habit That Changed Everything  
I no longer keep a to-do list.  

Instead of writing tasks for myself, I write them **directly to an agent**.  
The agent is the execution layer.  
That simple shift freed me from planning overhead and gave me back focus.  

---

## 7. Your First Steps Toward Agent-First  
If you're starting lean, here's where to begin:  

1. **Map tasks, not titles.** Break down the work that needs to get done before you hire. Many tasks can be agent-driven.  
2. **Expect imperfection.** Review outcomes, not micro-manage.  
3. **Spend the tokens.** The ROI is in the time you buy back.  
4. **Stack agents + automations.** Real leverage comes when they work together. For example, [Hud.io](https://www.hud.io/) + [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) fixing issues, not just reporting them.  

---

## My Current Stack  
Here's what runs my business for about $1K/month:  

- **Coding** → [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)  
- **Product analysis** → [Hunch.dev](https://www.hunch.dev/) + [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)  
- **Marketing** → [Toffu.ai](https://www.toffu.ai/)  
- **Production debugging** → [Hud.io](https://www.hud.io/)  
- **Monitoring & fixing** → [Sentry Seer](https://sentry.io/for/seer/)  
- **Deploys** → Vercel + Render bots  

Equivalent output: ~6 roles (~$600K/year).  
Actual cost: ~$12K/year.  
That's a **50× difference**.  

---

## Closing Thoughts  
Agent-first isn't about saving tokens.  
It's about saving headcount, burn, and decision fatigue.  

The founders who learn to work this way now will build leaner, faster companies — and they'll scale with less overhead.
