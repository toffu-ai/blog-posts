> *“I used to joke that I was a script kiddie. I could hack things together, but that’s not my business. My dad used to say: ‘Give the flour to the baker.’ I know how to build automations, but I don’t want to make a business out of it. That’s where Toffu comes in.”* — **Zion Karsenti**  

[Armato](https://armatousa.com/) sells apparel, but behind the scenes, **Zion Karsenti** is managing much more than clothes. As a media agency, he runs ads across **15+ Google Ads accounts** in multiple currencies, experimenting with everything from e-commerce to SaaS. For years, he relied on a web of scripts and homegrown tools to keep things moving—until Toffu replaced them all.

## From Scripts to Scale  

Before Toffu, Zion’s toolkit was a patchwork: Google Ads App Scripts for daily automations, a self-built API service for keyword planning, even a custom chat interface to control it all.  

It worked—but it wasn’t sustainable.  

Managing advanced strategies like **SKAGs (Single Keyword Ad Groups)** highlighted the limits. Running 30 of them in a test campaign just wasn’t possible manually.

## Why Toffu  

When Zion discovered Toffu, it clicked.  

> *“Toffu saved me a suite of tools I had to maintain myself. Now I just talk to it, and campaigns are live in minutes.”*  

Instead of juggling fragile scripts, he could focus on the bigger picture:  

- **[Keyword planning](https://toffu.ai/use-cases/keyword-research)** built in.  
- **[Automation](https://toffu.ai/lp/google-ads-automation)** without maintenance headaches.  
- **Chat-based campaign setup** that feels natural.  

Even on Taboola, where integrations are notoriously clunky, Toffu surprised him:  

> *“I tried running a campaign and Toffu just used the company logo as the image. I thought it was odd, but the campaign actually performed better than expected. It worked.”*

## Results That Matter  

With Toffu, execution stopped being the bottleneck.  

- One Google Ads campaign built with Toffu hit a **30% CTR**, compared to **3%** on a parallel campaign managed manually.  
- He can now manage **30 SKAGs at once**, something he never would have attempted before on small budgets.  
- Instead of spending time coding, he spends it optimizing strategy.  

> *“Toffu doesn’t decide the strategy—I do. But it executes fast, clean, and at scale.”*

## The Bigger Picture  

For Zion, Toffu isn’t just about convenience. It’s about turning ambitious strategies into reality.  

> *“The real power of AI for media buyers is saving us from the Sisyphean grind. The more granular you get, the better results you’ll achieve. Toffu lets me go deeper without the manual pain.”*  

He hasn’t handed over his largest accounts yet—it takes time to trust new tools—but Toffu has already proven itself as the **execution engine** behind his experiments.  

And he’s already looking beyond apparel: Zion is exploring how Toffu can power PPC for construction clients in Los Angeles, where leads are worth hundreds of dollars and execution speed makes all the difference.

✅ **Key takeaway**: Zion no longer needs to be the baker building automations—Toffu handles that, so he can focus on media buying and strategy.
