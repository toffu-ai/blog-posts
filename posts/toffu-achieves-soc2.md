We're thrilled to announce that Toffu AI has successfully achieved **SOC 2 Type 1 certification**, a significant milestone that demonstrates our unwavering commitment to security, privacy, and operational excellence. Additionally, we're currently in the observation period for **SOC 2 Type 2 certification**, further solidifying our dedication to maintaining the highest industry standards.

## What This Means for Our Customers

SOC 2 certification isn't just a badge—it's a comprehensive validation of our security practices and organizational controls. This achievement means that Toffu has been independently audited and verified to meet stringent security standards across five key trust service principles:

- **Security**: Safeguarding customer data against unauthorized access
- **Availability**: Ensuring our systems are accessible when you need them
- **Processing Integrity**: Maintaining accurate and complete system processing
- **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure
- **Privacy**: Collecting, using, and disposing of personal information responsibly

## Our Security-First Approach

At Toffu, security isn't an afterthought—it's foundational to everything we build. This certification validates what we've always believed: that innovation and security must go hand in hand.

### Key Security Highlights:

## What's Next: SOC 2 Type 2 Observation

While we celebrate our SOC 2 Type 1 achievement, we're already working toward the next milestone. We're currently in the observation period for **SOC 2 Type 2 certification**, which involves a longer audit period to demonstrate that our controls are not just designed effectively, but also operating effectively over time.
