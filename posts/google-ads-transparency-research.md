3. **Cross-reference industries**: Look for companies in adjacent verticals
4. **International expansion**: Check if competitors are expanding to new markets

### Phase 2: Ad Creative Analysis

1. **Collect ad variations**: Gather all active ads from target competitors
2. **Categorize messaging themes**: Group ads by value proposition or campaign type

Use competitive intelligence to differentiate:
