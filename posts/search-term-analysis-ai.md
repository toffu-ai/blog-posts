# How to Use AI Automation for Google Ads Search Term Analysis

Analyzing Google Ads search term reports feels like drinking from a fire hose while trying to spot patterns in chaos. You're scrolling through thousands of search queries, manually categorizing each one as relevant or irrelevant, trying to remember which terms you've already flagged in other campaigns, and watching your budget disappear on searches you should have blocked weeks ago.

Here's the exhausting reality every PPC manager faces: **search term analysis is completely manual**, yet it's one of the most critical tasks for campaign performance. You're essentially playing detective with thousands of data points, trying to identify patterns that determine whether each search represents a potential customer or wasted spend.

But what if AI could process those thousands of search terms instantly and surface the patterns you'd never catch manually?

## Why Google Ads Search Term Analysis Needs Automation

Here's what one PPC professional recently shared about their search term analysis challenges:

> "We spend a lot of time manually analyzing Search Term Reports (SQRs) in Google Ads- filtering out irrelevant queries and identifying potential positives. This is a repetitive task across accounts with different KPIs." - [u/Old-Career-9931](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1li82kx/looking_for_ai_solution_to_automate_search_term/)
