# Stop Manually Adding Sitelinks: Why Google Ads Automation Is Your New Best Friend

Manual sitelinks setup is torture. You click Assets → Extensions → Plus button → Sitelink. Fill out 25-character headlines and 35-character descriptions. Enter destination URLs. Repeat for every campaign and ad group.

As [rikpik shared on r/PPC](https://reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1mdxop0/how_to_get_auction_insights_data_to_looker_studio/): *"I have about 30 clients and it is super time consuming to do it manually."* 

For a mid-sized agency with 50 campaigns, that's easily 10-15 hours per month just on sitelinks setup and updates.

## Why Sitelinks Matter

[Google's data](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375416?hl=en) shows sitelinks boost performance significantly. You get more ad space, better user experience, and detailed click tracking.

On mobile, up to 8 sitelinks can show. On desktop, up to 6 with descriptions. Since most searches happen on mobile, good sitelinks aren't optional.

## The Manual Process Wastes Time

Here's what manual sitelink setup looks like:
1. Navigate to Assets in Google Ads
2. Click plus → Sitelink 
3. Choose campaign/ad group level
4. Write 25-character headlines (usually too long, start over)
5. Add 35-character descriptions (also too long)
6. Enter destination URLs
7. Repeat for every sitelink
8. Repeat for every campaign

Now multiply by dozens of campaigns. Plus seasonal updates. Plus performance optimization.

While you're stuck doing this, you're not analyzing performance data, testing ad copy, or optimizing bids.

## How Toffu Automates Sitelinks

```

```

- Better CTRs from AI-optimized combinations
- Consistent sitelinks across all campaigns
- No more forgotten or outdated sitelinks

## The Bigger Picture

Manual sitelinks are just one example of repetitive tasks eating up PPC managers' time. Whether it's [negative keywords](https://toffu.ai/blog/ai-automation-negative-keywords-google-ads) or [budget reallocation](https://toffu.ai/blog/budget-reallocation-automation-winning-campaigns), automation is transforming how we work.

The PPC managers who embrace automation for tedious work can focus on strategy, analysis, and creative problem-solving. The ones doing everything manually get left behind.

## Getting Started

Track how much time you spend on sitelinks setup. Pick a few campaigns and test automation. Don't automate everything at once.

The goal isn't to automate everything - it's to automate the stuff that doesn't need your brain so you can use your brain on what matters.
