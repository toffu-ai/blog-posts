# Toffu is Now Available in Slack: AI Marketing Manager in Your Workspace

Marketing teams spend countless hours switching between tools - from Slack conversations to campaign dashboards, from analytics platforms to content creation tools. This constant context switching breaks focus and slows down execution, especially when quick marketing decisions need team input or immediate action.

**Today, we're excited to announce that Toffu is now available directly in Slack**. Your AI marketing manager can now work alongside your team in the communication platform you already use every day.

## Why Marketing Teams Need AI in Slack

Marketing workflows are inherently collaborative but often fragmented across multiple platforms. Teams discuss strategies in Slack, then jump to Google Ads for campaign management, then to Analytics for performance review, then back to Slack to share results.

### The Context Switching Problem

A typical marketing team's daily workflow looks like this:

1. **Morning standup in Slack**: "Our conversion rate dropped yesterday"
2. **Switch to Google Ads**: Check campaign performance and identify issues
3. **Switch to Analytics**: Deep dive into traffic and conversion data
4. **Switch to Google Sheets**: Create performance report
5. **Back to Slack**: Share findings and discuss next steps
6. **Switch to campaign management**: Implement changes
7. **Back to Slack**: Update team on changes made

This constant switching creates friction that slows down decision-making and execution.

### Real-Time Marketing Decisions

Marketing performance changes throughout the day. When a campaign starts underperforming or a new opportunity emerges, teams need to:
- **Quickly analyze** what's happening
- **Collaborate** on the best response
- **Execute changes** immediately
- **Monitor results** in real-time

Having your AI marketing manager in Slack enables instant analysis and execution without leaving your communication flow.
