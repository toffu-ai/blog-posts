# How One Motorcycle Community 12x'd Their Sign-Ups

**Company:** [Motorcycle Riders Hub](https://motorcycleridershub.co.uk/)  
**Founder:** Simon Hayes
**Industry:** Motorcycle training and digital education  
**Team Size:** Small distributed team  
**Product:** Motorcycle training app \+ digital training logbook used by schools across the UK

## Overview

For 4 years, Simon ran Meta ads trying to grow Motorcycle Riders Hub. The product was strong. The demand was real. But the marketing results weren’t. Most weeks brought **20–40 free sign-ups** — not enough to scale. Ad spend was inconsistent, targeting was broad, and campaigns felt like guesswork.

Then Simon started using Toffu. Within weeks, **sign-ups rose to \~500 per week**, without raising ad spend. In fact, **he spent less**.

“Where I’ve been fumbling around for the last 4 years, Toffu gave me the exact route through. It was a rocket boost.”

---

## The Challenge

- Simon spent **4 years running Meta ads** without a clear strategy.  
- Campaigns brought in low-quality leads.  
- Money went out; results didn’t grow.  
- No in-house marketing lead, and agencies were too expensive.

“I’ve been playing with Facebook for years — a little money in, wasting a lot. I didn’t realize how much was wrong in the backend.”

The issue wasn’t effort. It was structure.

---

## Why Toffu Made the Difference

Simon had already tried ChatGPT and other AI tools.

They could write.  
But they couldn’t *think*.

“The info from Toffu is far more detailed and thorough. It gives strategy, reasoning, and an exact plan. It’s like having a marketing team I can’t afford.”

Toffu didn’t just output text.  
It **audited systems**, **restructured campaigns**, and **challenged business decisions**.

“It’s like having a thousand marketers sat together debating and then giving me the best option.”

## What Changed

### 1\. Meta Account Rebuild

Together with Toffu, Simon:

- Turned off all active ads  
- Rebuilt campaign structure  
- Refined targeting to match learner intent  
- Cleaned conversion tracking  
- Rewrote messaging based on real fears and motivations

**Outcome:**  
Sign-ups jumped from **20–40/week** → **\~500/week**.  
**Ad spend decreased.**

“I haven’t increased spend. I’ve *decreased* it — and it’s now hitting the right people.”

---

### 2\. Google Business Profile Upgrade

Toffu rewrote:

- Services  
- Descriptions  
- Product listings

This increased clarity and credibility across search touchpoints.

---

### 3\. Strategic Plan \+ Exit Path

For the first time, Simon has:

- A structured content direction  
- A paid funnel roadmap  
- A pricing and retention model  
- A **long-term growth and exit strategy**

“I now know what to do every week, every month — and even how to position the business for exit in a few years.”

---

## The Turning Point: Radical Honesty

Simon told Toffu:

“Hold me to account. Be brutally honest.”

One day it responded:

“I can smell bullshit.”

Simon laughed — because it was right to push him.

“It challenged my assumptions. That moment shifted everything. It stopped being a tool and started being a teammate.”

- Build the strategy first.  
- Then automate.
