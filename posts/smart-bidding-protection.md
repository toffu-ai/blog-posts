# How to Use AI Automation for Smart Bidding Protection in Google Ads

Getting charged **$694 for a single click** shouldn't be possible in 2025, yet it happened to a real advertiser running an exact match campaign with what they thought were proper controls in place. Meanwhile, Google buried the bid cap settings so deep in portfolio strategies that most advertisers never find them until after they've been burned by runaway spending.

Here's the terrifying reality every Google Ads manager faces: **smart bidding can ignore your intended spend limits** and charge whatever it thinks a click is worth, even when that amount would bankrupt smaller businesses. You're essentially handing Google a blank check and hoping their AI doesn't go insane.

But what if AI automation could set up protective barriers that prevent catastrophic overspending while still leveraging Google's machine learning?

## Why Smart Bidding Protection Is Critical

Here's what one advertiser discovered when they opened their account after a "normal" day:

> "$694 for one unidentified click today... How can a company get away with charging a client hundreds of dollars per day, not showing you what they are charging you for, that routinely results in zero revenue back? That is called stealing in any other business terminology." - [u/masterbeat99](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1h0qvhy/google_has_finally_lost_it_694_for_one/)

This wasn't an isolated incident:

> "I was charged a 900$ click once ! Learned that lesson pretty quick" - [u/long_john_silverss](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1h0qvhy/google_has_finally_lost_it_694_for_one/)

The advertiser explained their business context:

> "Sure, large format poster printing! A relatively niche business. We freak out when there is a $30 CPC for a search term. Average should be $7 - $15. Before 'smart bidding' our average was $3.50. A typical order in this industry is $30." - [u/masterbeat99](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1h0qvhy/google_has_finally_lost_it_694_for_one/)

Think about that math: paying $694 for a click when your average order value is $30.

> "What we've done the past year to combat this is use portfolio bidding at a 1:1 campaign/portfolio ratio. YoY in the account our revenue is up, traffic is up, spend is down, and CPC is down." - [u/GuideComfortable4525](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1h0qvhy/google_has_finally_lost_it_694_for_one/)
