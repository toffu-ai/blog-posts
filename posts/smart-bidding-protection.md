# Smart Bidding Protection: AI Safeguards for Google Ads
Last month, your Target CPA campaign burned through a week's worth of budget in two days. The AI was "learning," Google said. Your CFO wasn't impressed.
This scenario plays out daily across thousands of Google Ads accounts. Smart Bidding promises automated optimization, but without proper safeguards, it can turn into an expensive lesson in letting machines make budget decisions.
Mike Thompson, a PPC manager at a B2B SaaS company, shared his experience: "Our Target ROAS campaign went rogue during Black Friday. Spent $8K in six hours chasing a 4x ROAS target that was completely unrealistic for that traffic volume. Had to manually pause everything."
The solution isn't avoiding Smart Bidding - it's building intelligent protection systems that let AI optimize while preventing budget disasters.
This scenario plays out daily across thousands of Google Ads accounts, especially during high-traffic periods like Black Friday when Smart Bidding algorithms face unusual traffic patterns they haven't learned to handle effectively.

- Gradually increase automation as confidence in the system grows

### 2. Human Oversight Integration
- Always maintain human review of automated actions
- Implement approval workflows for significant budget changes
- Regular review and adjustment of protection thresholds
## Don't Make These Mistakes
### 3. Continuous Learning
**Mistake #1: Over-Protection**
Setting thresholds too tight kills AI optimization potential. Start loose and tighten based on actual performance.
**Mistake #2: Alert Overload**
Too many notifications = ignored notifications. Use severity levels and batch similar alerts.
**Mistake #3: Set-and-Forget Thresholds**
Market conditions change. Review and adjust protection settings monthly.
**Mistake #4: Assuming You're Safe**
Protection systems need regular testing. Run monthly "what-if" scenarios to validate your safeguards.
