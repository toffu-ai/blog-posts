## Why Social Listening on Reddit Matters

Before we dive in, here's why Reddit is crucial: Reddit users discuss brands authentically in ways that traditional social listening tools miss completely. [Companies that respond to customer service requests on social media see customers spend 20-40% more](https://www.sprinklr.com/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics/) with their brand.

But here's the problem most businesses face:

> "I'm looking for a simple, accurate tool to monitor brand sentiment on Reddit, ideally one that can pick up positive or negative mentions and notify our team in real time." - [u/Potential_Return2000](https://reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1m7vnaj/any_good_brand_monitoring_tools_that_can_track/)

Traditional tools miss the context. Reddit users don't always mention your brand name directly - they use slang, abbreviations, and discuss your industry in ways keyword searches miss.

That's exactly what we're going to fix.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Social Listening with Toffu

**What you're doing:** Having a conversation with Toffu to set up Reddit monitoring that understands your brand context.

### Start the Conversation

1. **Go to Toffu**: Visit [toffu.ai](https://toffu.ai/) and start a chat

2. **Tell Toffu about your brand**: 
```
"I want to set up social listening for [your brand name]. We're a [brief description of your business] and I need to monitor Reddit for brand mentions, competitor discussions, and industry conversations."
```

3. **Provide context about your brand**:
```
"Here's what you should know about our brand:
- Our main product is [product name]
- Our top 3 competitors are [competitor names] 
- Our customers often discuss [key problems your product solves]
- We're particularly interested in mentions in [relevant subreddits]"
```

### Let Toffu Learn Your Brand Context

4. **Upload brand information**: Toffu will ask for brand guidelines, competitor info, and customer personas. This goes into its Knowledge base so it understands what to look for.

5. **Define what matters**: Tell Toffu:
```
"I want to be alerted immediately if:
- Someone complains about our product with negative sentiment
- There's a discussion comparing us to competitors
- Someone asks for solutions in our industry
- There's high engagement on posts mentioning our brand"
```

### Connect Reddit Integration

6. **Connect your Reddit account**: Toffu will guide you through connecting Reddit using OAuth authentication. This lets it monitor discussions across all relevant subreddits.

## Step 2: Create Your Social Listening Tracking Sheet

**What you're doing:** Setting up a Google Sheet that automatically captures and organizes all brand mentions with actionable data.

### Set Up Automated Google Sheets Tracking

7. **Create your tracking system**:
```
"Create a Google Sheet called 'Social Listening Dashboard' and set it up to automatically track:

Column A: Date/Time of mention
Column B: Platform (Reddit)
Column C: Subreddit name
Column D: Post/Comment title
Column E: Mention text (the actual quote)
Column F: Sentiment score (-1 to +1)
Column G: Engagement level (upvotes, comments)
Column H: Urgency level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
Column I: Response required (Yes/No)
Column J: Response status (Pending/Completed/Not Needed)
Column K: Link to original post
Column L: Follow-up needed (Yes/No)

Make sure to share this sheet with [team member emails] so everyone can access it."
```

This approach connects directly to successful [social media strategy](https://toffu.ai/use-cases/social-media-strategy) implementations where insights from community listening inform broader content and engagement decisions.
