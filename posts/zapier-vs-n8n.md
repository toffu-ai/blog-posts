Your team is drowning in manual tasks. Copy-pasting data between apps, sending the same emails over and over, updating spreadsheets manually. You've heard about workflow automation, but the options feel overwhelming.

Two names keep coming up: Zapier and n8n. One promises simplicity, the other offers unlimited power. But which one actually delivers results for your business?

This is a comprehensive comparison and in-depth dive into two popular platforms in the automation software sector. We've put these platforms to the test, taking a close look at key functionality provided by each. This is an elaborate exercise to help you understand which one might work better for you. By the time you finish with this article, you should have a good sense of the platform that might be a good fit for you.

## What Are Zapier and n8n? Understanding Workflow Automation Tools

**Zapier** is an automation platform based on cloud technology that connects more than 7,000 applications and services using the straightforward 'if this, then that' principle. It was established in 2011, and today it is among the foremost platforms for no-code automation. Users of Zapier achieve automated workflows that have elegant and programmable logic without really having to program because the platform is very simple to use.

**n8n** (nodemation), an open-source tool for workflow automation, enables both beginners and more experienced users to build and control their workflows quite transparently. Just like with any nodemation tool, users create with n8n in a drag-and-drop style that doesn't really require knowledge of any specific programming language. But what's particularly great about building workflows with n8n is that you can go beyond just combining already existing apps and services.

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Zapier | n8n |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Type** | Proprietary SaaS | Open-source (with paid cloud) |
| **Pricing Model** | Task-based | Execution-based |
| **Self-hosting** | Not available | Available (free) |
| **Custom Code** | Limited | Extensive (JavaScript, Python) |
| **App Integrations** | 7,000+ | 400+ (growing rapidly) |

## Zapier Pricing vs n8n Cost: Which Automation Platform Fits Your Budget?

It is vital to comprehend the cost structures of both platforms if one is to make a decision with any pretense of budgetary awareness. But before I get into the nitty-gritty of pricing, let me state the obvious: Free services usually come with a catch.

### Zapier Pricing (2025)

The action of a Zap step, an integration, or a filter is considered a task. Each task performed counts and is reflected at the top of the dashboard in the task use meter, which shows how many tasks you've undertaken so far in that month:

- **Free Plan**: 100 tasks/month, 5 Zaps, basic integrations
- **Professional Plan**: $19.99/month (750 tasks), unlimited Zaps, premium apps
- **Team Plan**: $69/month (2,000 tasks), shared workspaces, admin features
- **Entferprise Plan**: Custom pricing, advanced security, dedicated support

**Here's the thing**: Zapier can become expensive quickly. Its pricing is based on task consumption. A task is any step in a workflow. If you have a simple workflow that triggers—for instance, an RSS feed update—your task consumption might remain pretty low. But complex automations that are reliable for you to run at scale are going to require their cloud to serve you by executing a lot of workflows. For pay-by-the-month users, complex automations can run costs up in a hurry.

### n8n Pricing (2025)

n8n provides a usage-based pricing model that charges for workflow runs instead of tasks:

- **Community Edition**: Free (self-hosted), unlimited workflows
- **Starter Plan**: €20/month (2,500 executions with unlimited steps)
- **Pro Plan**: €50/month (10,000 executions), advanced features
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom pricing, dedicated support, SLA

**Main Benefit**: In n8n, whenever you trigger an automation sequence, the entire set of actions—no matter how many there are—counts as a solitary run execution. You're not being dinged for every little thing that you add to your workflow; you're not being dinged for the kind of work that you do. And if you're dipping into this app for complex automations, then that's a major plus in favor of going with n8n.

### Real-World Cost Comparison

Let's say you have a workflow that:
1. Receives a webhook
2. Processes data in 3 steps
3. Updates a CRM
4. Sends an email notification
5. Logs to a spreadsheet

**Zapier**: This would consume 5 tasks per run (each action = 1 task)
**n8n**: This would consume 1 execution per run (entire workflow = 1 execution)

For 1,000 runs per month:
- **Zapier**: 5,000 tasks required (~$69/month Team plan)
- **n8n**: 1,000 executions (~€20/month Starter plan)

## Open Source vs SaaS: n8n's Free Alternative to Zapier's Premium Model

One of the most significant differentiators between these platforms is n8n's open-source nature, and honestly, it's a game-changer for many teams.
