## Head-to-Head Comparison

### Primary Purpose

**n8n**: A versatile tool that works with almost any service or API. It can handle virtually any technical process you might need to automate across your organization. Your use cases are only limited by your imagination.

**Clay**: A specialized platform carving out its niche in data enrichment, lead generation, and go-to-market automation. Clay focuses specifically on sales and marketing workflows, giving you software-enabled tools to enhance what you're already doing.

### Technical Complexity

**n8n**: Requires more technical know-how, especially for advanced workflows. It's built for developers and technical teams who want precise control over their automations.

**Clay**: Offers a more intuitive interface built for the frontlines of sales, marketing, and RevOps. You don't need to be a tech wizard to get started—if you can use basic office software, you can use Clay.

### Data Enrichment Capabilities

**n8n**: Can connect to data providers through APIs but doesn't offer native data enrichment. You'll need to build these connections yourself.

**Clay**: Purpose-built for data enrichment with 130+ premium data sources included. It's designed to maximize your data coverage and quality with minimal effort.

### Deployment Options

**n8n**: Available as self-hosted (on your own servers) or cloud-based. This gives you total control over your data and connected systems—you can see what's happening at every step.

**Clay**: Primarily cloud-based SaaS with enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 Type II compliant). Everything runs through your browser or mobile app.

### Pricing Model

**n8n**: Offers both an open-source community edition and paid plans. Pricing is based on users, workflows, and executions rather than data usage. With the open-source version, there are no limits.

**Clay**: Subscription-based with pricing tied to data enrichment credits and features. It's more focused on what data you're consuming rather than how complex your workflows are.

### AI Capabilities

**n8n**: Strong focus on AI workflow automation, letting teams build complex systems that can call custom tools. Great for teams who want a no-code approach to sophisticated processes.

**Clay**: AI centered on research, data cleaning, and personalized content creation specifically for sales and marketing scenarios. It enhances your creative capabilities and helps you communicate more effectively.

## Use Case Scenarios

### When n8n Excels:

1. **Cross-Departmental Automation**: When you need to connect processes across different teams (IT, DevOps, Sales, etc.)
2. **Custom API Integration**: When dealing with unusual APIs that need special handling
3. **Data Privacy Requirements**: When sensitive data must stay on your own servers
4. **Complex Conditional Logic**: When your workflows need sophisticated "if this, then that" branching
5. **Developer-Centric Teams**: When you have the technical chops to build and maintain complex workflows

### When Clay Excels:

1. **Sales Prospecting**: When building targeted lead lists and enriching contact data is your goal
2. **CRM Data Maintenance**: When keeping your CRM data clean and up-to-date is a priority
3. **Intent-Based Outreach**: When timing messages based on signals like job changes or funding rounds
4. **Marketing Campaigns**: When creating targeted, data-driven marketing initiatives
5. **Non-Technical Teams**: When your sales and marketing folks need automation without coding skills

## Integration Capabilities

Both platforms offer extensive integration capabilities, but with different approaches:

**n8n**: Packed with ready-to-use nodes for popular services, plus the ability to build custom request nodes for any API. This makes n8n as much a web application automation toolkit as a business automation platform—you can do anything any node in the system is capable of doing.

**Clay**: Specializes in robust integrations with sales and marketing tools like Salesforce, email sequencers, and data providers. It also plugs into workflow automation platforms like Zapier, ensuring all your tools talk to each other reliably.

## Customer Examples
